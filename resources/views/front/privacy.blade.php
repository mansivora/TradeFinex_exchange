                                <p>Be aware that bitcoin, ether, and other Digital Assets are not necessarily truly
                                    anonymous. Generally, anyone can see the balance and transaction history of any
                                    public Digital Asset address. We, and any others who can match your public Digital
                                    Asset address to other Personal Information about you, may be able to identify you
                                    from a blockchain transaction. This is because, in some circumstances, Personal
                                    Information published on a blockchain (such as your Digital Asset address and IP
                                    address) can be correlated with Personal Information that we and others may have.
                                    This may be the case even if we, or they, were not involved in the blockchain
                                    transaction. Furthermore, by using data analysis techniques on a given blockchain,
                                    it may be possible to identify other Personal Information about you. As part of our
                                    security, anti-fraud and/or identity verification and authentication checks, we may
                                    conduct such analysis to collect and process such Personal Information about you.
                                    You agree to allow us to perform such practices and understand that we do so.<br>

                                    protective measures you should take, as well. Do not share your Personal Information
                                    with others unless you clearly understand the purpose of their request for it and
                                    you know with whom you are dealing. Do not keep sensitive Personal Information in
                                    your e-mail inbox or on Webmail. If you are asked to assign passwords to connect you
                                    to your Personal Information, you should use a secure password and always use
                                    two-factor authentication (2FA), where available. You should change your password
                                    regularly.</p>
